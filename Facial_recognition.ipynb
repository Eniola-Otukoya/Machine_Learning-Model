The program is capable of detecting faces in real-time using the computer's webcam, and it draws a rectangle around each face detected. The use of the Haar cascade classifier makes the face detection process more efficient and accurate. This program can be further improved by implementing additional features such as face recognition, tracking, and identification. Overall, this program serves as a solid foundation for building more sophisticated facial recognition systems.\n"
