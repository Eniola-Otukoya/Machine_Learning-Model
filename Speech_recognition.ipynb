It initializes a recognizer class and reads from the microphone as a source.

If the API is unable to recognize the speech, it returns an error message. The transcribed text is then displayed on the user interface. Overall, this code provides a good starting point for building a speech recognition app and can be extended to meet more complex requirements.\n"
